## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to help us learn and understand the fundamentals of machine learning by implementing algorithms from scratch. By avoiding high-level libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow, we can focus on the core mathematics and logic behind each algorithm. It helps to deepen our understanding of core concepts and contribute to building a valuable resource for the community.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Linear Regression for Single Features**
2. **Linear Regression for Multiple Variables (Features)**

## Installation

To use this repository, you need to have Python and NumPy installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yordanoswuletaw/machine-learning-algorithms-from-the-beginning.git
cd machine-learning-algorithms-from-the-beginning
```

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in its own directory with a detailed README explaining the theory, math, and code. You can run the algorithms by navigating to the respective directory and executing the Python script. For example:

```bash
cd linear_regression
python linear_regression.py
```

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
